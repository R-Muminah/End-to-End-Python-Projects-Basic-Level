# End-to-End-Python-Projects-Basic-Level

This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects that I built while learning the basics of programming.  
These projects are small, fun, and educational â€“ perfect for someone starting out with Python.  
They focus on practicing core Python concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, and file handling.

## Projects Included

### 1. Number Guessing Game
A simple console game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.  
The player has up to 5 attempts to guess the correct number, and the program gives feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or out of range.  

**Skills practiced:**  
- Working with `random` module  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Input validation  
- Basic console interaction

---

### 2. Hangman Game
A simple console word-guessing game where the player tries to guess the letters of a randomly chosen word.  
The player has a limited number of attempts (twice the length of the word) to guess all the letters correctly.  

**Skills practiced:**  
- Working with lists and strings  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Input validation  
- Basic console interaction

---

### 3. 21 Number Game
A simple console game where players take turns adding 1, 2, or 3 to a running total starting at 0.  
The player who reaches or exceeds 21 loses the game.  
The game can be played by one or more players, with the computer taking a turn automatically if only one human player is present.  

**Skills practiced:**  
- Loops and turn-based logic  
- Functions and program structure  
- Input validation  
- Basic console interaction

---

### 4. To-Do List
A simple console program to manage tasks.  
Users can add new tasks, view all tasks, and delete tasks. The tasks are saved in a JSON file, so they persist between sessions.  

**Skills practiced:**  
- Working with lists and JSON files  
- Functions and modular code  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Basic console interaction
